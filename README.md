# Palindrome-Checker

- This palindrome checker aims to provide a tool to check if a word, number, phrase, or sequence reads the same backwards as forwards.
- It is one of the FreeCodeCamp "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects".

## Requirements

- The requirements for the project are:
  - Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.

  - A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

  - You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.

- It needs to pass in all tests, including: 

  - Strings with varying formats, such as "racecar", "RaceCar", and "race CAR" among others.
  - Strings with special symbols, such as "2A3*3a2", "2A3 3a2", and "2_A3*3#A2".

## How to install and use it?

Considering it uses only vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS, it is not necessary to install additional features. 
Just download the files and double click on the index.html file.
It works fine in Chrome (Version 73.0.3683.86), Firefox (Version 66.0.2) and Safari (Version 12.0.3).
